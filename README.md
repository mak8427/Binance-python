Financial Data Analysis

This project is designed to analyze financial data from a CSV file. The data includes various columns such as volume, number of trades, and open/close prices. The main goal of this analysis is to compute the absolute difference between open and close prices, and explore the relationships between volume, number of trades, and the computed differences.
